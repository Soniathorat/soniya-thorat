# Pet Store API Test Automation

# Overview
This project automates API testing for the Pet Store API using REST Assured and TestNG.  
It verifies core functionalities, including:  
- Adding a new pet  
- Fetching pet details  
- Updating pet information  
- Deleting a pet  

# Setup Instructions

# Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
- Java 17  
- Maven  
- Docker 

# Installation
Clone the repository and install dependencies:
git clone https://github.com/Soniathorat/soniya-thorat.git
cd petstore-api-automation
mvn clean install


# Running the Tests

# Running Locally
To execute tests on your local machine:
mvn test

# Running with Docker
To run tests inside a Docker container:

1. Build the Docker image:
   docker build -t pettest-runner .


2. Run the container:
   docker run --rm pettest-runner

# Report Verification
- After execution, test reports can be found in the 'target' folder.  
- Use this command to open the reports (Linux/macOS):
  
  open target/surefire-reports/index.html

- On Windows, manually navigate to 'target/surefire-reports/'.

# Tech Stack and Approach

# Tools Used
- REST Assured – API testing framework  
- TestNG – Test execution framework  
- Maven – Dependency and build management  
- Docker – Containerized execution  

# Approach
- Dependency Management – Used Maven to manage dependencies efficiently.  
- Test Execution Order – Configured TestNG with 'dependsOnMethods' to ensure tests run in the correct sequence.  
- Assertions & Validations – Implemented TestNG assertions to validate API responses dynamically.  
- Dockerization – Enabled running tests inside a container to avoid local setup issues.  

# Summary
- Covers CRUD operations for the Pet Store API.  
- Uses REST Assured and TestNG for automation.  
- Supports both local execution and Dockerized execution.  
- Designed to be scalable, maintainable, and easy to use.
